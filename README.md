# PPK2-rs

Rust library and CLI for working with Nordic Semiconductor's Power Profiler Kit II. Far from complete, but can be used at least with the PPK2 functioning as a source meter.

Heavily based on [nrfconnect-ppk](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-ppk) and its derivate [ppk2-api-python](https://github.com/IRNAS/ppk2-api-python).

To install, run:

```
cargo install ppk2
```

If you want to use this crate as a library, you can take inspiration from [src/main.rs] to get an idea of how to use it.
